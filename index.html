  <h3>Week 1</h3>
  <p>The first week was great and we spent most of the time getting situated.
  We started on Tuesday May 28th by getting our accounts and information
  situated. We meet the rest of the mentors and participants in the program and
  got started working on our assignments. We read an article about how to read a
  research paper and then got started learning about Probabalistic Road Maps. We
  spent the rest of Tuesday reading the articles and answering the discussion
  questions which we then finished on Wednesday. On Thursday May 30th we got
  started working on the basic design of our websites. We then went to lunch and
  when we came back we began downloading and running the vizmo and PMPL files.
  On Friday May 31 we spent the morning working with the XML files and changing
  the paramaters to better understand the methods. We looked at different PMPL
  algorithms such as Uniform Random Free, Gauss, OBPRM and MAPRM and how
  changing certain paramaters would increase runtime, nodes and collisions. We
  then had a meeting run by Diane to discuss the information in the first part
  of the crash course. This discussion marked the end of the first lesson.

  <h3>Week 2</h3>
  <p>We finished module 2 on Monday June 2nd where we compiled and ran code in PMPL 
    and vizmo. We analyzed the CfgExamples.xml to betterunderstand the values that 
    were being passed in and how to set up our own functions. We strarted module three 
    on Tuesday June 3rd where we read an article on configuration space. We then 
    programmed our own motion planning strategy. In this class we implemented functions 
    such as ParseXML, Print, Initialize, Run, Finalize, GenerateNode and ConnectNode. 
    On Wednesday June 4th we read an article on Sampling based Algorithms such as EST's 
    and RRT's. We then began coding our own EST sampling algorithm. Writing it took the 
    rest of Wednesday and all of Thursday June 5th. We then spent Friday June 6th figuring 
    out ways that we could improve our EST algorithm and make it better. I noticed that a 
    lot of the random nodes weren't helpul interms of quickly finding a path so I used a 
    function that would "randomly" find nodes that were closer to the goal configuration 
    based on its topological distance. I used topological distance instead of euclidean 
    to account for obstacles. Next week we are going to finish the crash course and get 
    started on our research projects. 
    
     Monday - Finished module 2 where we ran and recorded data in PMPL. 
     Tuesday - Article on configuration space and coding our own PMPL class MyStrategy. 
     Wednesday - Article reading then lunch and then started working on the code MyEST. 
     Thursday - Finished working on the code and analyzed the results in vizmo. Continued the readings. 
     Friday - Worked on improvbing the EST code. Had a meeting about the past modules. Worked on our websites.
