  <center> <h3>Week 1</h3>
  <p style = "width: 600px;" >
  	  The first week was great and we spent most of the time getting situated.
	  We started on Tuesday May 28th by getting our accounts and information
	  situated. We meet the rest of the mentors and participants in the program and
	  got started working on our assignments. We read an article about how to read a
	  research paper and then got started learning about Probabalistic Road Maps. We
	  spent the rest of Tuesday reading the articles and answering the discussion
	  questions which we then finished on Wednesday. On Thursday May 30th we got
	  started working on the basic design of our websites. We then went to lunch and
	  when we came back we began downloading and running the vizmo and PMPL files.
	  On Friday May 31 we spent the morning working with the XML files and changing
	  the paramaters to better understand the methods. We looked at different PMPL
	  algorithms such as Uniform Random Free, Gauss, OBPRM and MAPRM and how
	  changing certain paramaters would increase runtime, nodes and collisions. We
	  then had a meeting run by Diane to discuss the information in the first part
	  of the crash course. This discussion marked the end of the first lesson.

	<h3>Week 2</h3>
  <p style = "width: 600px;">We finished module 2 on Monday June 2nd where we compiled and ran code in PMPL 
	    and vizmo. We analyzed the CfgExamples.xml to betterunderstand the values that 
	    were being passed in and how to set up our own functions. We strarted module three 
	    on Tuesday June 3rd where we read an article on configuration space. We then 
	    programmed our own motion planning strategy. In this class we implemented functions 
	    such as ParseXML, Print, Initialize, Run, Finalize, GenerateNode and ConnectNode. 
	    On Wednesday June 4th we read an article on Sampling based Algorithms such as EST's 
	    and RRT's. We then began coding our own EST sampling algorithm. Writing it took the 
	    rest of Wednesday and all of Thursday June 5th. We then spent Friday June 6th figuring 
	    out ways that we could improve our EST algorithm and make it better. I noticed that a 
	    lot of the random nodes weren't helpul interms of quickly finding a path so I used a 
	    function that would "randomly" find nodes that were closer to the goal configuration 
	    based on its topological distance. I used topological distance instead of euclidean 
	    to account for obstacles. Next week we are going to finish the crash course and get 
	    started on our research projects. 
	
	     Monday - Finished module 2 where we ran and recorded data in PMPL. 
	     Tuesday - Article on configuration space and coding our own PMPL class MyStrategy. 
	     Wednesday - Article reading then lunch and then started working on the code MyEST. 
	     Thursday - Finished working on the code and analyzed the results in vizmo. Continued the readings. 
	     Friday - Worked on improvbing the EST code. Had a
	     meeting about the past modules. Worked on our websites.

  <h3>Week 3</h3>
  <p> Monday - Morning, read the OBPRM article and answered module 5 questions. <br>
  Read the grad students articles and annotated them. <br>
  Tuesday - Read the grad students article on proteins. Lunch. Ran our EST code against different paths and 
  wrote our websites. We then had a meeting to discuss the projects that we might work on.<br>
  Wednesday - We spend the morning reading the research paper write ups that the grad students wrote. <br>
  We then had a lunch meeting where we had a Q and A about grad school. <br> 
  Then spent the rest of the afternoon working with the coast files and creating an environment in vizmo. <br>
  Thursday - Read and researched articles on Dijkstra's. Downloaded the IT files and began looking at the code in <br>
  the TMP library. All of the Dijkstra's articles I read are all just modificiations of the original Dijkstra's <br> 
  algorithm. The concept that we are using is sub graphs and trying to find a graph based off of weight <br>
  constaints. What if the most idea weight path is in between restrictions (the weight is 5 and it can't be <br>
  between 4 and 6), then we need to find an alternate path. This is where the idea of the subgraphs comes in. <br>
  Friday - Got familiar with the Dijkstras code in home/lucasmf2/PMPL/pmpl/src/Utilities/SSSP.h because we are <br>
  going to have to use this for the Yens algorithm. I then figured out Yen's algorithm and started writing pseudocode. <br>
